## ⚡ What is Data Analytics? (1:00–2:00)
At its core, data analytics is simply:  
1. **Collecting Data** – From sensors, sales, surveys, or logs.  
2. **Cleaning Data** – Removing duplicates, fixing errors, formatting it.  
3. **Analyzing Data** – Using tools like Excel, Python, or SQL.  
4. **Visualizing Data** – Charts, dashboards, and storytelling.  

It’s about finding **patterns and meaning** in the noise.

Start simple, grow big:  

- **Excel** – Great for entry-level analysis and dashboards.  
- **SQL** – To query databases and pull specific information.  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** – For cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets.

## 🌍 Real-World Example (3:30–4:30)
Here’s one from my own journey 👇  

When I worked on **engine room data**, I collected vibration, oil pressure, and temperature readings.  
At first, it was just numbers on paper.  
But with Python and pandas, I turned it into **charts and KPIs** that revealed trends — showing when engines needed maintenance before breakdowns.  

That’s data analytics in action — saving time, money, and even preventing accidents.
